# OpenAI Agents SDK â€“ Practice & Exam Prep

This repository contains my practice work and preparation projects for mastering the **OpenAI Agents SDK**.  
It includes experiments, tutorials, and custom agent implementations covering core concepts like:

- **Agent & Runner** â€“ creating and running agents
- **Context Management** â€“ passing state and memory
- **Guardrails** â€“ validating inputs and outputs
- **HandsOff** â€“ restricting LLM autonomy where needed
- **Tools Integration** â€“ connecting external APIs and Python functions
- **Workflows** â€“ building step-by-step multi-agent processes
